  %p Arquillian really is awesome. I am from the Meyer school of noise is a pernicious enemy. And delay is a form of noise. Having JBoss 6 running and just repeat running the tests from my key mapping is a freaking joy. Huge improvement over the Spring tests.

  %p I recently got introduced to Arquillian. Arquillian is a JBoss project for providing better testing to the Java EE stack. Arquillian utilizes ShrinkWrap, another great project, for creating virtual archives as deployments to the container. It's all pretty damn slick :)
  %p I encourage you to take a dive into the community. It's well organized and alive.

  %p Thanks for a great product. This reminds me of the old Cactus project back in the day, but done much, much better.

  %p I'd like to say that, the API design, the documentation and last but not least the quality of the code base is really impressive.

  %p All in all Arquillian is a really great integration testing tool with full of potential. It's just great that the JBoss guys are aiming to provide support for almost all widely used application servers and web containers.
  %p If you are writing an application for the Java EE 6 stack while not using Arquillian is a serious mistake!
