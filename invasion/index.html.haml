   Arquillian is a platform that simplifies integration testing for Java middleware. We transparently handle the plumbing of container management, deployment and framework initialization - leaving you to focus on the task at hand, writing your test logic.

   h2{color: #8c3d33}. Arquillian makes integration testing a breeze!

   Arquillian minimizes the burden on you--the developer--by covering aspects surrounding test execution, including:

   * Managing the lifecycle of the container (start/stop),
   * Bundling the test class with dependent classes and resources into a deployable archive,
   * Enhancing the test class (e.g., resolving @@Inject@, @@EJB@ and @@Resource@ injections),
   * Deploying the archive to test (deploy/undeploy) and
   * Capturing results and failures.

   To avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into the developer's build environment, Arquillian integrates seamlessly with familiar testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit 4, TestNG 5), allowing tests to be launched using existing IDE, Ant and Maven test plugins -- without any add-ons.
